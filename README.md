# number_OF_Mosquito_Prediction

The City of Winnipeg and Decision Works organized Open Data Hackathon Where participants make some contribution based on Data of the City Provided to them. I determined that some virus like West Nile Virus spread by mosquitoes which can cause paralysis of brain. There is no vaccine or medicine for this virus. So to help city to reduce rate of such mosquito we came with idea to predict future count of mosquitoes based on whether data so that city can determine it's stretegy to counter such problems. 

We used data of Mosquito bites on different location of Winnipeg and Combine the whether data collected from Government of Canada. 

We assume that the birth rate of mosquito depends on whether of the day. so We applied Machine Learning on this data to predict future mosquito birth rate accross city. It will help city to determine requirements of chemical to counter mosquito problem across the different locations.
